# SVM-Based Data Classification and Dimensionality Reduction

## üìå Project Overview

This project explores data classification and dimensionality reduction techniques using Support Vector Machines (SVM), t-SNE, MDS, and LDA. The main objective is to analyze different datasets, reduce their dimensionality for visualization, and classify them using SVM models with various kernels.

## üöÄ Features

**Data Preprocessing:** Loading, cleaning, and normalizing datasets.

**Dimensionality Reduction:**

- t-SNE (t-Distributed Stochastic Neighbor Embedding) for non-linear visualization.

- MDS (Multidimensional Scaling) for preserving distances.

- LDA (Linear Discriminant Analysis) for supervised dimensionality reduction.

- Classification with SVM:
  - Linear SVM for evaluating separability.

  - SVM with RBF kernel for improved classification.

  - Comparison with polynomial kernel SVM.

**Decision Boundary Visualization:** Displaying decision regions for classification tasks.

## üõ†Ô∏è Installation & Setup

1Ô∏è‚É£ Clone the repository
